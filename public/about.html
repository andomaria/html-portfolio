<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Maria, and I’m just starting my journey in web development. So far,
  I’ve been learning HTML and I’m excited to keep exploring more about building
  websites.
</p>

<p>
  I’m passionate about learning new skills and improving step by step. I love
  experimenting with code, discovering how websites work, and taking on small
  projects to practice what I learn.
</p>

<p>
  I’m looking forward to growing my knowledge and sharing my progress here. Feel
  free to explore my projects and follow along with my learning journey!
